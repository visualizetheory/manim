Animations are made using ManimCE v0.18.1. If you are interested in learning manim I recommend the following:

1. Get a basic understanding of Python and object-oriented programming. An introductory lecture is CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python (https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/).
2. Watch Benjamin Hackl's manim tutorial series (https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/examples.html). The official manim-Example Gallery is also helpful (https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/examples.html).
